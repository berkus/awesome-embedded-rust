Please note that this project is released with a [Contributor Code of Conduct](Code-of-Conduct.md). By participating in this project you agree to abide by its terms.

# The pull request should have a useful title. Pull requests with `Update readme.md` as title will be closed right away because I'm so tired of nobody reading this document. Please carefully read everything in `Adding to this list`.

## Adding to this list

Please ensure your pull request adheres to the following guidelines:

- Search previous suggestions before making a new one, as yours may be a duplicate.
- Make sure the item is useful before submitting. The awesome lists aim to list actually awesome projects, not collect the names of all projects in existence.
- Make an individual pull request for each suggestion.
- Use [title-casing](http://titlecapitalization.com) (AP style).
- Use the following format: `[Item Name](link) Description text`
- Link additions should be added to the bottom of the relevant alphabetical category.
- Check your spelling and grammar.
- Make sure your text editor is set to remove trailing whitespace.
- The pull request and commit should have a useful title. When you add a project - at least use `Add projectX` as title. See [this article](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/) on guidelines to good commit messages.
- The body of your commit message should contain a link to the repository.

Thank you for your suggestions!

## Updating your Pull Request

Sometimes, a maintainer of an awesome list will ask you to edit your Pull Request before it is included. This is normally due to spelling errors or because your PR didn't match the awesome-* list guidelines.

[Here](https://github.com/RichardLitt/knowledge/blob/master/github/amending-a-commit-guide.md) is a write up on how to change a Pull Request, and the different ways you can do that.
